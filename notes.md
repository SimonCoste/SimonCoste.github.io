## Flow-based generative models

These series of notes focus on diffusion-based generative models, like the celebrated Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models; they contain the material I regularly present as lectures in some working groups for mathematicians or math graduate students, so the style is tailored for this audience. In particular, everything is fitted into the continuous-time framework (which is not exactly how it is done in practice).
