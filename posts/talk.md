## Talks on the characteristic polynomial of random matrices 


The slideshow is [here](/talks/mas2022/). 

[imj](/talks/imj/)

It's written in markdown then converted to HTML with pandoc. Then I use CSS styling and Reveal.js for smooth effects. You can see an example [on my Gitlab](https://gitlab.inria.fr/scoste/slides). 

## Talk on spectral clustering on directed graphs

Slideshow for my GDRÂ talk is [here](/talks/isis/).
